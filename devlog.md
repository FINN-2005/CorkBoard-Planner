These days are purely hypothetical, meaning there might be between 0 to 20 actual days in between each day.  
This is because I'm doing this project while actively ignoring my end sem exams.  

## day 1:  
- made the cork.png tile (256 by 256) via my pygame_template and it's built in perlin noise function  
- started the main.py file  
- made the infinite tiling corkboard  
- added pan-ing capabilities  

## day 2:  
- added zoom capabilites  
- layed out slight structure like various base classes and the paper class  
- started base paper class  

## day 3 :  
- major progress on the paper class  
- published current progress on github (made readme too)  
- picked out colours for the paper, made them tilt randomly for the nice to see factor  
- changed to global variables to make zoom and pan work with the paper  

## day 4:  
- added ability to spawn paper anywhere wiht mouse click  
- added hundreds of papers, still got over 200 to 300 fps (mind you the papers only included a purple rectangle and nothing else)  
- made a prototype look of what i want the paper content editing system to look like (prototypes.html)  
- planned major optimisations for v0.2 (a mouse router + grid based page hit test)  
- made this devlog.md file
